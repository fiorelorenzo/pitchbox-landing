# Refuses a tag whose CI run for that exact commit is not a completed success. Looks up
# every run of the named workflow for the given commit sha and evaluates the most
# recent one -- a commit can have more than one run if CI was re-triggered, and only
# the latest attempt should count.

# Ported unmodified in behaviour from canonry-landing's scripts/deploy/verify-ci.sh
# (~/projects/personal/canonry-landing, the reference implementation named in #422):
# this repository's own ci.yml is the workflow it checks.
#
# Usage:
#   verify-ci.sh --repo OWNER/NAME --sha SHA [--workflow ci.yml]
#
# --stdin reads the `gh api .../runs` JSON from stdin instead of calling gh, for
# offline testing of the evaluation logic against a fixture.
